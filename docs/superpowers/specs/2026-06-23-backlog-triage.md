# Backlog Triage — 2026-06-23

## Project Goal

A reusable configuration UI library for ESP32 (and potentially Arduino/ESP8266)
devices. Developers define their settings as JSON, include the JS/CSS/HTML, and
implement a small set of HTTP+WebSocket endpoints. The goal is to define a clean
cutting line: what this library provides vs what the developer's project provides.

---

## High Priority

### 1. Fix form validation

**Status:** Bug — required fields don't show `:invalid` styling (red borders)
after the WS + blur refactor.

**Likely cause:** `bindChangeListeners` calls `el.checkValidity()` but never
calls `el.reportValidity()`. Pico CSS relies on native `:invalid` pseudo-class,
which may not trigger from `checkValidity()` alone on every browser. The
original validation spec called for `reportValidity()` on blur but the
implementation only checks validity and gates buttons — it never reports
invalidity to the user or the CSS engine.

**Fix:** Add `el.reportValidity()` call in the blur/change handler.

### 2. ESP32 backend implementation

**Goal:** A reusable C/C++ library (ESP-IDF component) that implements the API
contract the Python test server currently provides.

**Scope:** More than matching the test server, less than a full turnkey firmware
image. The library should:

- Serve the static files (HTML, JS, CSS) from SPIFFS/LittleFS
- Implement the unified `/api/settings` JSON structure
- Handle WebSocket connection per the existing protocol (`action: "apply"`,
  `type: "settings"`, `type: "status"`)
- Track `_dirty` (NVS vs applied values), push on connect
- Handle `/api/settings/save` (persist to NVS)
- Support status variables (read-only fields pushed over WS)
- Provide clear hooks/callbacks for the developer's project to register
  settings and status components

**Out of scope (for now):**
- Reboot and firmware upload endpoints (see separate items)
- Auth
- mDNS
- Any project-specific business logic

**Cutting line:** The library handles the config UI plumbing (serve files,
serialize/deserialize settings, NVS persistence, WS lifecycle). The developer
supplies the component JSON definitions, status variable callbacks, and any
custom API endpoints beyond settings.

---

## Medium Priority

### 3. Edge cases — concurrent updates

**What:** Review and harden the state machine for edge cases not well covered:

- Rapid blur events (user tabs quickly through fields)
- WS disconnect during in-flight apply
- Multiple browser tabs connected to same device
- Fields with falsey values (0, false, "") — string coercion edge cases
- Status push arriving while conflict prompt is visible
- Server sends partial update (not all components)
- Save-and-apply with empty diff (only dirty flag set)

### 4. Navbar image + favicon

**What:** Support a logo image in the nav header and a favicon, both served as
static files from SPIFFS.

**Design:** By convention, if `/logo.png` and `/favicon.ico` exist on SPIFFS,
`index.html` includes them. No upload UI needed — developer places files at
build time.

**Changes:**
- `index.html`: add `<link rel="icon">` and `<img>` in header, gated by a
  simple existence check (or always present with `onerror` fallback)
- Max 2-3 lines of HTML

### 5. Group name labels

**What:** Optional `"label"` field in component JSON to override the
auto-derived label from `camelCase`/`snake_case` parsing.

**Current behavior:** `labelFromKey("wifi_ssid")` → `"Wifi Ssid"`.
`labelFromKey("AudioInterface")` → `"Audio Interface"`.

**New behavior:** If a component provides `"label": "Wi-Fi Configuration"`,
use that directly. Otherwise fall back to `labelFromKey(key)`.

**JSON shape change:**
```json
{
  "wifi": {
    "_label": "Wi-Fi Configuration",
    "ssid": ["text", "SSID", {"value": "MyNetwork"}]
  }
}
```

Meta key `_label` fits the existing `_`-prefix convention for metadata.

**Changes:** 2-3 lines in `processSettings`.

### 6. Reset to saved state

**What:** A "Reset" button that tells the server to reload NVS settings into
applied values, then pushes the result to the client over WS.

**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Reset" → POST `/api/settings/reset`
2. Server loads NVS → applied values (discarding any live-only changes)
3. Server pushes full settings + `_dirty=false` over WS
4. Client receives like a normal settings push — form updates, baseline resets

**Note:** The test server already has `/api/settings/reset` for e2e tests.
This would make it a real feature.

**Changes:**
- Client: add Reset button in footer, POST handler
- ESP32 backend: implement the reset endpoint (reload NVS → AV)
- Test server: already exists

---

## Lower Priority

### 7. Reboot server

**What:** A "Reboot" button that POSTs to `/api/system/reboot`.

**Flow:** Click → confirm dialog → POST → show "Rebooting..." with countdown →
WS will naturally disconnect → show "Connection lost, retrying..." → reconnect
automatically when device comes back.

**ESP32 side:** `esp_restart()` call on endpoint hit.

### 8. Firmware upload

**What:** An OTA firmware update page.

**Minimal version:** File input + "Upload" button → POST multipart to
`/api/firmware/upload` → shows success/error message.

**Nice-to-have:** Progress bar via XMLHttpRequest `upload.onprogress` event
(works without WS). ESP32 must support chunked OTA updates for this.

**ESP32 side:** ESP-IDF OTA API (`esp_ota_begin`, `esp_ota_write`,
`esp_ota_end`).

### 9. Export/import settings

**What:** Download current settings as a JSON file, upload a JSON file to
restore them.

**Flow:** "Export" button → browser download of `/api/settings` response.
"Import" button → file picker → POST JSON to `/api/settings/import` (or reuse
`/api/settings/save`).

### 10. Basic auth

**What:** Optional HTTP Basic Auth gate on the settings endpoints.

**Out of scope for library:** This belongs at the developer's project level
(ESP-IDF middleware/handler wrapper). The library should not own auth, but
should document how to add it.

### 11. Spec/plan doc tidy ✅ (completed 2026-06-24)

**What:** The `docs/superpowers/` tree was tidied. Outdated specs were
deleted, form validation concepts were merged into the master architecture
spec, and status variables improvements were merged into the status design
spec. The implementation plan lived at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-doc-tidy.md` while the work was in progress.

**Final state:**

| File | Kept? |
|---|---|
| `2026-06-18-unified-settings-design.md` | ✓ Master architecture spec |
| `2026-06-23-status-variables-design.md` | ✓ Status design (absorbed improvements) |
| `2026-06-23-checkbox-archive.md` | ✓ Archive — checkbox removal record, `checkpoint/checkbox` branch ref |
| `2026-06-23-backlog-triage.md` | ✓ This document |
| `2026-06-24-code-issues.md` | ✓ Bugs found during tidy |

**Result:** 8 specs → 5 specs, 2 ref files → 0 ref files, `plans/` directory deleted.

### 12. GitHub representation + integration docs

**What:** A polished README with:
- Screenshot of the UI
- Quick-start guide (3 steps: add JSON files, include HTML/JS/CSS, implement 3
  endpoints)
- Full API reference (JSON format, WS protocol, HTTP endpoints)
- ESP32 integration example (ESP-IDF component setup)
- Link to a demo/test project

Firmware upload ───> (needs ESP32 backend, most complex)
Export/import ─────> (needs nothing, pure client + save endpoint)

```

## Recommended Order

1. Doc tidy (clean slate, makes everything easier to find)
2. Validation fix (quick bug fix, unblocks nothing but annoying)
3. Group name labels (trivial, 5-minute change)
4. Nav image/favicon (trivial, 5-minute change)
5. Edge cases audit (important before backend, could catch JS protocol issues)
6. ESP32 backend (biggest item, enables everything else)
7. Reset button (needs backend)
8. Reboot (needs backend)
9. Firmware upload (needs backend, most complex)
10. Export/import (can be done independently)
11. GitHub/docs (last, to reflect final state)
